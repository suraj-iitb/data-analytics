**What**: Extract useful pattern from data

**How**: Algorithms/Models/Architecture

**How (Practical)**: 

## Types of Data Analytics

1. Descriptive Analytics (Business Intelligence)
    - It is 'bread and butter' of data analytics
    - Describes past data (what happend?) using statistics & representation
    - Statistics: Count, Average, Mean, Median, Mode, Variance etc
    - Representation: Tables, Plots (Bar, Pie, Box etc)

      - Contains KPI (Key Performance Indicators)

2. Predictive Analytics (Advanced Analytics)
    - Describes causal relationship (why did it happen?) using correlation analysis, statistical significance test
    - Describes future (what will happen?) using ML Models
    - Problem Statement for future use case
      - Forecasting 
      - Propensity Modelling: Identify likelihood of someone performing a certain actions (accept offer, make purchase, churning, sign up for a newsletter etc)
      - ROI (Return on Investment)
      - Segmentation
    - Problem Statement for causal relationship use case
      - Diagnostoic Tool

3. Prescriptive Analytics (Advanced Analytics)
    - Describes actions (what should be done?) using ML Models
    - Problem Statement
      - Recommendation System
      - Autonomous Agents
