# Data Platform

**What**: A data platform does the following for data:
1. Acquisition
2. Storage
3. Delivery
4. Preparation
5. Governance
6. Security

**How**: It integrates different pieces of technologies (Cloud, Data Lake, Data Warehouse, SQL DB, NoSQL DB, Data Pipeline, Storage, Processing (Spark), AI/ML) - Otherwise it will lead to Data Silos (unscalable, duplicate data, out-of-date data)

## Data Platform Architecture

Architecture should have the following characteristics:
1. Power to user: develop data pipeline
2. Power of hybrid cloud
3. Shared, Virtual Data Layer: diverse data formats
4. Scalable Data Integration: batch ingestion from legacy sources, pub/sub for asynchronous event messages, stream processing for real-time data
5. Extensible Processing Logic
6. Automation for flexibility
