# Data Platform

**What**: A data platform does the following for data:
1. Acquisition
2. Storage
3. Delivery
4. Preparation
5. Governance
6. Security

**How**: It integrates different pieces of technologies (Cloud, Data Lake, Data Warehouse, SQL DB, NoSQL DB, Data Pipeline, Storage, Processing (Spark), AI/ML) - Otherwise it will lead to Data Silos (unscalable, duplicate data, out-of-date data)
